Kivy Designer is Kivy's tool for designing Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) from Kivy Widgets. 
You can compose and customize widgets, and test them. It is completely written in Python using Kivy. 
Kivy Designer is integrated with Buildozer and Hanga, so you can easily develop and publish your applications to Desktop and Mobile devices.
